![Coming Soon](src/assets/wip.png)

I'm excited to announce that I'm building a personal blog. This space will be home to my thoughts on web development, technical explorations, and lessons learned along the way.

## What to Expect

Right now, the blog is under construction. I'm setting up the infrastructure to publish posts about frontend development, React and Vue patterns, and whatever else captures my interest in the world of web technologies.

## Why Start Now

Building a blog felt like a natural next step. It's a way to document my learning, share what I've picked up from my experience, and contribute to the broader development community. Plus, it's a good excuse to experiment with new tools and approaches on my own site.

## Technical Notes

I'm using MDX for the blog, which lets me write markdown with the power of React components. Here's how I set up the basic structure:

```typescript
import BlogPost from '@/components/blog-post/my-blog-post.mdx'

export function BlogSection() {
  return (
    <BlogPost />
  )
}
```

It's a nice balance between simplicity and flexibility for long-form content.

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out the rest of my site or reach out if you have questions or just want to chat about web development.
